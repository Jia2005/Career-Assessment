# 🚀 MyCareer

Feeling super confused about what you're meant to do with your life? I get it! 🙃

Hey there! Career decisions are THE WORST, right? Those career fairs where everyone's handing out pens and asking "So what's your five-year plan?" Ugh. And everyone's always like "follow your passion!" but what if you're passionate about sleeping and eating pizza? 😅 

That's why I built this little app to help sort through all the career chaos. Most academic advisors aren't cutting it (sorry not sorry), so I figured I'd build something that actually asks the right questions. It's been super helpful for students who are in that "what am I even doing here" phase of college life!

## What makes this thing cool? ✨

This isn't some boring corporate career matcher. I wanted something that actually *gets* students:

* **Personal quiz thingy** 📋 - Find how your interests, strengths, and personality actually fit together
* **Smart suggestions** 💡 - Get courses and resources that actually make sense for YOU
* **Connect with people** 👋 - Chat with others who are just as lost as you are (it helps!)
* **Read some stuff** 📚 - Users share their career journeys and advice (some are hilarious 😂)
* **No boring career tests** ⚡ - This isn't about forcing you into some random job box - it's about finding what actually makes you tick!

## Get started!

Stop overthinking your future and just try something new! Why keep doing the same "take an interest survey" stuff that hasn't been working? Hours of scrolling through those lists of careers on university portals and taking those silly "What Hogwarts house are you?" personality tests somehow aren't magically revealing perfect majors. Nothing works until you start focusing on the actual stuff that matters - what classes you don't fall asleep in, what you're naturally good at, and what kind of environment you need.

This app isn't magic (I wish!), but it asks better questions than those generic career quizzes. And honestly, sometimes just looking at yourself differently is exactly the fresh perspective you need to try something new. What's the worst that could happen? You end up with a slightly different existential crisis? 🤷‍♀️

## Try it yourself!

Coming soon on Vercel 😉

P.S. I built this because I was tired of those "Take this test to find your dream job!" sites that tell everyone to either become a software engineer or a graphic designer lol. This is just me trying to make something better and making a difference!
